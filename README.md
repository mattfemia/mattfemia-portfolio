# Matt Femia Web Application
  
Flask application used as a digital resume, staging application deployments, and for showing freelance clients mockups of their projects.  
  
## CI/CD & AWS Deployment Architecture

This app has a CI/CD deployment configuration using TravisCI and AWS:  
  
- First changes to the Master branch trigger Docker image to push up to an existing repo on AWS ECR  
- Then changes to $IMAGE_REPO:latest on ECR trigger automated setup of new ECS Task Definition
- Finally, the existing EC2 instances on the ECS cluster push updates through the Auto-Scaling Group on the Application Load Balancer  

## Main site application  
  
- Single-page Dockerized Flask application used as digital resume  
- Details about my education, experience, projects, publications, and more is found here  
- Application is hosted using AWS architecture and sits behind an application load balancer to route traffic to each subdomain
